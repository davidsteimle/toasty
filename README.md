# Toast for Windows Version

My initial purpose was to alert users that their system had been updated to a newer version of Windows. The inclusion of the image was for branding. Limiting the number of files was important, so I am using an image converted to Base64. This process uses *[Burnt Toast](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast).*

The end goal is to make an exportable Toast message that can be deployed without *Burnt Toast*.

Currently, I am getting the Base64 manually
